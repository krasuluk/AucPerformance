This code implements the performance evaluation methodology described in the paper:
L. Krasula, K. Fliegel, P. Le Callet, M.Klima, "On the accuracy of objective image 
and video quality models: New methodology for performance evaluation", QoMEX 2016.

When you use our method in your research, please, cite the above stated
